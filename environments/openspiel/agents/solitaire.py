Setup: 52-card deck shuffled randomly. 7 tableau columns with 1-7 cards (top card face-up).
Remaining cards form the stock pile (dealt 3 at a time to waste pile).

Goal: Move all cards to 4 foundation piles (one per suit), building from Ace to King.

Card Movement:
1. TABLEAU: Build descending sequences in alternating colors (Red 7 on Black 8)
   - Can move single cards or sequences
   - Empty tableau spaces can only be filled by Kings
   
2. FOUNDATIONS: Build ascending sequences by suit (A♠ → 2♠ → 3♠ ... → K♠)
   - Must start with Ace of each suit
   - Build up in same suit only

3. STOCK/WASTE: Draw 3 cards from stock to waste pile
   - Top waste card is playable
   - Can cycle through stock pile multiple times

WINNING: All 52 cards successfully moved to foundations (sorted by suit, Ace to King)

STRATEGY HINTS:
- Prioritize revealing face-down tableau cards
- Empty tableau columns are valuable (only Kings can fill them)
- Don't rush to move cards to foundations - keep playable cards in tableau for flexibility
- Plan moves to create long sequences and reveal hidden cards
- Move Aces to foundations immediately

CARD NOTATION:
- Suits: ♠ (Spades), ♥ (Hearts), ♣ (Clubs), ♦ (Diamonds)
- Ranks: A, 2-10, J, Q, K
- 🂠 = face-down card"""
